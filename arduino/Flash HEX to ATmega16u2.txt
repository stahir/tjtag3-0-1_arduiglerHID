make sure your that your ATmega16u2 chip on Arduino UNO R3 is running HoodLoader2 and is in bootloader mode
use avrdude to put hex file, make sure to replace with correct com port, in my example its COM5


avrdude.exe -Cavrdude.conf -v -patmega16u2 -cavr109 -PCOM5 -b57600 -D -Uflash:w:arduigler.hex:i
